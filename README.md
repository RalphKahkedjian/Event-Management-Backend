# Event Management Project

## Overview

This is an Event Management System where users can register as organizers to create tickets or as attendees to book tickets. It's my first full-stack project, built using a Laravel backend and a ReactJS frontend, communicating via APIs.

## Features

- **User Registration & Authentication**: Users can sign up as either an organizer or an attendee.
- **Organizer Role**:
  - Create events and tickets.
  - View a list of created tickets.
- **Attendee Role**:
  - Browse and book tickets for events.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: ReactJS
- **Backend**: Laravel
- **APIs**: Used for all backend communication

N.B: My two event management projects are related, so make sure to clone both projects
